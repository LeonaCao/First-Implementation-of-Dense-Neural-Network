# Lung-Cancer-Mortality-Rate-Prediction

This is a course project applying dense neural network modeling during the Intro to Deep Learning course I am taking at UConn in Fall 2020.

In this project my teammates and I have created a data set merging lung cancer data with health insurance, poverty, and income data to predict the cancer mortality rate (source: https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-linear-regression-model-tutorial/workspace/data-dictionary). 

Before modeling we did a bunch of work preparing our data and conducted exploratory data analysis. While modeling, we also used baseline models including linear regression, random forest, and decision tree along with dense neural network to compare their performance. Moreover, for the dense neural network part we not only set up a basic architecture but also implemented a k-fold cross-validation to improve our model.
